description: Napoleon Bonaparte was born on August 15, 1769 in Ajaccio on the Mediterranean
  island of Corsica. Through his military exploits and his ruthless efficiency, Napoleon
  rose from obscurity to become Napoleon I, Empereur des Francais (Emperor of the
  French). He is both a historical figure and a legend and it is sometimes difficult
  to separate the two. The events of his life fired the imaginations of great writers,
  film makers, and playwrights whose works have done much to create the Napoleonic
  legend.
